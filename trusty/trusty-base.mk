# This makefile should be included by devices that use Trusty TEE
# to pull in the baseline set of Trusty specific modules.

# For gatekeeper, we include the generic -service and -impl to use legacy
# HAL loading of gatekeeper.trusty.

# Allow the KeyMint HAL service implementation to be selected at build time.  This needs to be
# done in sync with the TA implementation included in Trusty.  Possible values are:
#
# - Rust implementation:   export TRUSTY_KEYMINT_IMPL=rust
# - C++ implementation:    (any other value of TRUSTY_KEYMINT_IMPL)

    # Default to the C++ implementation
