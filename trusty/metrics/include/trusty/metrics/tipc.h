/**
 * DOC: Metrics
 *
 * Metrics interface provides a way for Android to get Trusty metrics data.
 *
 * Currently, only "push" model is supported. Clients are expected to connect to
 * metrics service, listen for events, e.g. app crash events, and respond to
 * every event with a &struct metrics_req.
 *
 * Communication is driven by metrics service, i.e. requests/responses are all
 * sent from/to metrics service.
 *
 * Note that the type of the event is not known to the client ahead of time.
 *
 * In the future, if we need to have Android "pull" metrics data from Trusty,
 * that can be done by introducing a separate port.
 *
 * This interface is shared between Android and Trusty. There is a copy in each
 * repository. They must be kept in sync.
