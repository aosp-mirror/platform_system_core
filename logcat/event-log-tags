# The entries in this file map a sparse set of log tag numbers to tag names.
# This is installed on the device, in /system/etc, and parsed by logcat.
#
# Tag numbers are decimal integers, from 0 to 2^31.  (Let's leave the
# negative values alone for now.)
#
# Tag names are one or more ASCII letters and numbers or underscores, i.e.
# "[A-Z][a-z][0-9]_".  Do not include spaces or punctuation (the former
# impacts log readability, the latter makes regex searches more annoying).
#
# Tag numbers and names are separated by whitespace.  Blank lines and lines
# starting with '#' are ignored.
#
# Optionally, after the tag names can be put a description for the value(s)
# of the tag. Description are in the format
#    (<name>|data type[|data unit])
# Multiple values are separated by commas.
#
# The data type is a number from the following values:
# 1: int
# 2: long
# 3: string
# 4: list
#
# The data unit is a number taken from the following list:
# 1: Number of objects
# 2: Number of bytes
# 3: Number of milliseconds
# 4: Number of allocations
# 5: Id
# 6: Percent
# Default value for data of type int/long is 2 (bytes).
#
# TODO: generate ".java" and ".h" files with integer constants from this file.

# These are used for testing, do not modify without updating
